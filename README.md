Introduction.

In this assessment, I developed a React Native application that fulfills key e-commerce functionalities. The application showcases a list of products, allowing users to view essential details for each product. Upon selecting a product, users can navigate to a detailed product page containing comprehensive information. Additionally, the application features a cart system where users can add or remove products, view a separate basket page with a cart total, and manage their selections efficiently. A favorite list option was also implemented to enhance user experience. The state management was handled using Redux Toolkit, chosen for its robust state management capabilities and seamless integration with React Native. Tailwind CSS was utilized for consistent and efficient styling across the application.
